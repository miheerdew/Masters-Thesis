\chapter{Basics}
Let me describe a class of two player games. Denote the two players by 0 and 1.

Take a graph $G=(V=V_0 \sqcup V_1,E)$ whose vertices are partitioned into those belonging to Player 0 and Player 1.
The play starting at $v_0 \in V$ proceeds as follows -

\begin{itemize}
  \item A token is intitially placed in $v_0$
  \item At any stage if the token is in a vertex $v \in V_i$ ($i \in \set{0,1}$), then
        player i moves the token to a vertex $w$ so that $(v,w) \in E$
\end{itemize}

A concrete realization of this play will be a path $\pi \in V^{\omega}$

\[
  \pi = v_0 v_1 v_2 \ldots
\]

Where -
\begin{itemize}
  \item $v_0$ was the veretx where the play started
  \item Assume $v_i \in V_j$, then at $i+1$th step, player $j$ decided to move the token to $v_{i+1} \in V$ such that $(v_i,v_{i+1}) \in E$.
\end{itemize}

After this infinite path $\pi$ is played, Player 0 is supposed to pay $f(\pi)$ units of money to Player 1, where $f$ is a function defined on infinite paths -

\[
    f : V^{\omega} \to \mathcal{R}
\]
