\chapter{Abstract}
    This is a literature survey on results for Parity, Mean payoff and Discounted payoff games. All of these are two player, perfect information, infinite duration games. We introduce these games, demonstrate algorithms to solve each of them, and the connections between them. These games have positional optimal strategies and their decision problems are in $\UP \cap \coUP$. However, whether any of them have a polynomial time algorithm or not is still an open problem.

\chapter{Acknowledgements}
I would like to thank my supervisor, Prof.~B~Srivathsan, for introducing me to infinite Automata and Games, and for all the helpful discussions that we have had.

I also wish to thank Prof.~Madhavan~Mukund, Prof.~S~P~Suresh, Prof.~Mandayam~Srivas and Prof.~Narayan~Kumar for the exciting courses in Logic, Automata Theory and Verification that I took under them.

Finally, I would like to thank Prof.~T~Parthasarathy who kindled my interest in Game Theory and encouraged me.
