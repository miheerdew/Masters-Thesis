This is my Master's thesis on Infinite duration games (in preparation).

## Presentation
These are my thesis defence slides.

To compile - change to the `presentation` directory and run -

```
./doit.sh
```

It might take a while to compile because of lot of overlays and requires multiple compilations because of biblatex. The final output will be stored in `presentation.pdf`

## Report
This is the thesis report (in preparation)

To compile - change to the `report` directory and run

```
./doit.sh
```
The final ouput will be stored in `thesis.pdf`.
